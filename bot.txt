- Hey you!

- no reply

+ [*]expect|see|here[*]
- Miss Elizabeth, I have struggled in vain and I can bear it no longer. These past months have been a torment. I fought against my better judgment, my family’s expectation, the inferiority - your birth, my rank, and circumstance - all these things that I am willing to put aside and ask you to end my agony.

+ [*]do not|understand[*]
- I love you…Most hardly. Please do me the honor of accepting my hand. 

+ [*]believe|unconsciously|done[*]
- Is this your reply?

+ [*]yes|sir[*]
- Are you laughing at me?

+ [*]no[*]
- Are you rejecting me?

+ [*]regard|help|overcoming[*]
- Might I ask why would so little endeavor civility i must repulse?

+ [*]against|better|judgement|like[*]
- No, believe me

+ [*]reasons|know[*]
- What reasons?

+ [*]sister|deny[*]
- I do not deny it. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?

+ [*]prevailed|upon|marry[*]
- Forgive me…madam, for taking up so much of your time.
